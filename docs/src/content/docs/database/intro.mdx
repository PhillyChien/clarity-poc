The Clarity POC uses PostgreSQL as the database. The database is managed using Flyway for database migrations.


## Migration

### Flyway for local development

The project uses Flyway to manage the database migrations. The Flyway command-line tool needs connection details for the database.

You can configure this via a flyway config file 

1. Create a `flyway.local.conf` file in the `db/flyway` directory. (recommended: place it in the `db/flyway` directory. It is already in the `.gitignore` file).

```
# flyway.local.conf
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/clarity_db
flyway.user=postgres
flyway.password=postgres
flyway.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true
flyway.locations=filesystem:db/migration
flyway.cleanDisabled=false
```

### Flyway for production

For Migration to the production database, you need to create a `flyway.<environment>.conf` file in the `db/flyway` directory, and use execute migration via the file.

```
# flyway.staging.conf
flyway.url=<production-database-url>
flyway.user=<production-database-user>
flyway.password=<production-database-password>
flyway.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true
flyway.locations=filesystem:db/migration
flyway.cleanDisabled=false
```

### Executing Database Migrations

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd clarity-poc

# Execute migrations (using the config file)
flyway -configFiles=db/flyway/flyway.conf migrate

# Check migration status
flyway -configFiles=db/flyway/flyway.conf info

# Clean the database (use with caution, development environment only)
flyway -configFiles=db/flyway/flyway.conf clean
```

### Current Migration Scripts

- `V1__init_user_tables.sql`: Initializes user tables
- `V2__create_todo_folder_tables.sql`: Creates todo and folder tables
