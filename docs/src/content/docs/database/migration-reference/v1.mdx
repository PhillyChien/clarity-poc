description: Initializes the database schema by creating the essential `users` table for account management and authentication.

## Purpose

This is the initial database migration script. Its purpose is to create the foundational `users` table, which is essential for storing user account information, managing user registration, handling authentication (login), and forming the basis for associating other application data with specific users.

## Changes Applied

This migration applies the following DDL changes:

1.  **Table Creation (`users`)**:
    * Creates the primary table named `users` to store all user account details.
    * Columns:
        * `id` (BIGSERIAL, PRIMARY KEY): Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each user.
        * `username` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL, UNIQUE): The unique username chosen by the user for login.
        * `email` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL, UNIQUE): The user's unique email address.
        * `password` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Stores the user's hashed password.
        * `role` (VARCHAR(20), NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'NORMAL'): Stores the user's role (e.g., 'NORMAL', 'MODERATOR'). *Note: This initial role implementation uses a simple VARCHAR column, which is later refined in V3*.
        * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp indicating when the user account was created.
        * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp indicating when the user account was last updated.
    * Constraints:
        * Ensures `username` and `email` are unique across all users.

2.  **Index Creation**:
    * `idx_users_username` on `users(username)`: Creates an index on the `username` column to significantly speed up user lookups during the login/authentication process.

3.  **Database Comments (`COMMENT ON ...`)**:
    * Adds descriptive comments directly into the database schema for the `users` table and its columns, serving as embedded documentation.

## Dependencies

As the first migration (`V1`), this script typically has no dependencies on prior application migrations. It assumes the base database and necessary extensions (if any) are already set up.

## Impact

* **Functionality**: Enables the core user registration and login functionality within the application. Provides the necessary structure to store user credentials and basic profile data.
* **Schema**: Establishes the central `users` table, which is expected to be referenced by many other tables created in subsequent migrations (via foreign keys like `user_id`).
* **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints on `username` and `email` prevent duplicate accounts.
* **Performance**: The index on `username` is crucial for efficient authentication performance as the user base grows.
* **Code Changes**: Requires corresponding backend application code for handling user registration (including password hashing), user login (including password verification), and potentially retrieving user details.
* **Foundation**: Creates the necessary `users` table and `id` column upon which `V2__create_todo_folder_tables.sql` and `V3__add_roles_permissions_postgres.sql` depend.

## (Optional) Rollback Considerations

* Manual rollback would involve dropping the created objects in reverse order:
    1.  Drop the index: `idx_users_username`.
    2.  Drop the table: `users`.
* No dedicated rollback script is provided. Being the initial migration, rolling this back effectively means resetting the application's user data schema.
