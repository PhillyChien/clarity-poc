Consistent and clear documentation for database migrations is crucial for understanding the evolution of the database schema and troubleshooting potential issues. Each migration SQL file should have a corresponding Markdown or MDX file documenting its purpose and changes.

## Standard Documentation Structure

Each migration documentation file should ideally include the following sections:

### 1. Header (YAML Front Matter)

Include basic metadata:

```plaintext
---
title: V[Number]__[Brief_Description].sql # e.g., V2__create_todo_folder_tables.sql
description: A concise summary of the migration's purpose.
lastUpdated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### 2. Purpose

Goal: Briefly explain why this migration is needed. What business requirement, feature, or technical necessity does it address?
Example: "To establish the database structure required for organizing tasks (todos) optionally within folders..."

### 3. Changes Applied

- Goal: Detail the specific DDL (Data Definition Language) or DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes made by the migration script. Be precise.
- Structure: Use sub-sections for clarity (e.g., Table Creation, Table Alteration, Index Creation, Data Update).
- Details for Table Changes:
    - Specify the table name.
    - List columns added, removed, or modified, including their data types, constraints (NOT NULL, DEFAULT, UNIQUE), and primary/foreign key definitions.
    - Mention any specific constraint details like ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE SET NULL.

- Details for Index Changes:
    - Specify the index name and the table/column(s) it applies to.
    - Briefly state the purpose of the index (e.g., "Speeds up queries retrieving...").

- Details for Data Changes:
    - Describe the data being inserted, updated, or deleted. Explain the criteria or scope of the data modification.

- Example:
    1. Table Creation (`CREATE TABLE folders`):
        - Creates a table named `folders`...
        - Columns:
            - `id` (BIGSERIAL, PRIMARY KEY): ...
            - `name` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL): ...
            - `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `users.id`...
        - Constraints:
            - `fk_folder_user`: Establishes... `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

    2. Index Creation:
        - `idx_folders_user_id` on `folders(user_id)`: Speeds up queries...

    3. Database Comments (`COMMENT ON ...`):
        - Adds descriptive comments to tables and columns...

    4. Dependencies
        - Goal: List any preceding migrations that must be applied successfully before this migration can run. This is crucial for understanding the execution order and potential failures.
        - Specify: Mention the exact filename(s) of the required preceding migrations.
        - Example: "This migration depends on the successful application of V1__init_user_tables.sql..."

### 5. Impact

- Goal: Describe the consequences of applying this migration.
- Consider:
    - What new functionality does it enable in the application?
    - Does it affect existing functionality?
    - Are there performance implications (positive or negative)?
    - Does it require corresponding changes in the backend or frontend code?
- Example:
    - "Enables the core functionality of creating, viewing, updating, and deleting folders and todo items."
    - "Establishes the relationships between users, folders, and todos."
    - "Provides necessary indexes for efficient querying..."

### 6. (Optional) Rollback Considerations

- Goal: If applicable, describe how to manually revert the changes made by this migration or mention if a specific rollback script exists. Note that Flyway typically encourages forward fixes rather than rollbacks.
- Example: "Manual rollback would involve dropping the todos and folders tables. No dedicated rollback script is provided."
