description: Creates the `folders` and `todos` tables, establishing the core structure for task management and organization.

## Purpose

This migration establishes the fundamental database structure required for the application's core task management features. It creates tables to store user-defined folders (`folders`) for organization and the individual task items (`todos`) themselves, allowing todos to be optionally grouped within these folders.

## Changes Applied

This migration applies the following DDL changes:

1.  **Table Creation (`folders`)**:
    * Creates a table named `folders` to store folder information used for organizing todos.
    * Columns:
        * `id` (BIGSERIAL, PRIMARY KEY): Auto-incrementing unique identifier for the folder.
        * `name` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL): The name of the folder.
        * `description` (VARCHAR(255), NULL): An optional description for the folder.
        * `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing the `users` table, indicating the owner.
        * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of creation.
        * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of the last update.
    * Constraints:
        * `fk_folder_user`: Foreign key on `user_id` referencing `users(id)`. Specifies `ON DELETE CASCADE`, meaning if a user is deleted, all their folders are automatically deleted.

2.  **Table Creation (`todos`)**:
    * Creates a table named `todos` to store individual todo items.
    * Columns:
        * `id` (BIGSERIAL, PRIMARY KEY): Auto-incrementing unique identifier for the todo.
        * `title` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL): The title or main text of the todo item.
        * `description` (VARCHAR(1000), NULL): An optional longer description for the todo.
        * `completed` (BOOLEAN, NOT NULL, DEFAULT FALSE): Flag indicating if the todo is marked as done.
        * `disabled` (BOOLEAN, NOT NULL, DEFAULT FALSE): Flag indicating if the todo has been disabled (e.g., by a moderator).
        * `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing the `users` table, indicating the owner.
        * `folder_id` (BIGINT, NULL): Optional foreign key referencing the `folders` table, linking the todo to a folder.
        * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of creation.
        * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of the last update.
    * Constraints:
        * `fk_todo_user`: Foreign key on `user_id` referencing `users(id)`. Specifies `ON DELETE CASCADE`, meaning if a user is deleted, all their todos are automatically deleted.
        * `fk_todo_folder`: Foreign key on `folder_id` referencing `folders(id)`. Specifies `ON DELETE CASCADE`, meaning if a folder is deleted, all todos within that folder are automatically deleted.

3.  **Index Creation**:
    * `idx_folders_user_id` on `folders(user_id)`: Speeds up queries retrieving folders belonging to a specific user.
    * `idx_todos_user_id` on `todos(user_id)`: Speeds up queries retrieving todos belonging to a specific user.
    * `idx_todos_folder_id` on `todos(folder_id)`: Speeds up queries retrieving todos within a specific folder (including those not in any folder, where `folder_id` IS NULL).

4.  **Database Comments (`COMMENT ON ...`)**:
    * Adds descriptive comments directly into the database schema for the `folders` and `todos` tables and their respective columns. These comments serve as embedded documentation for database administrators or developers inspecting the schema directly.

## Dependencies

This migration creates tables (`folders`, `todos`) that have foreign key dependencies on the `users` table. Therefore, it depends on the successful application of the migration that created the `users` table (e.g., `V1__init_user_tables.sql` or equivalent).

## Impact

* **Functionality**: Enables the core application functionality related to creating, reading, updating, deleting, and organizing todo items within folders.
* **Relationships**: Establishes the primary data relationships: users own folders and todos; todos can optionally belong to a folder. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` rules define automatic cleanup behavior when users or folders are deleted.
* **Performance**: Introduces indexes on foreign key columns (`user_id`, `folder_id`) to ensure efficient retrieval of tasks and folders based on user ownership and folder grouping.
* **Schema**: Adds two major tables (`folders`, `todos`) and associated indexes/constraints to the database.
* **Code Changes**: Requires corresponding backend application code to interact with these new tables (e.g., repository/service layers for folders and todos).

## (Optional) Rollback Considerations

* Manual rollback would require dropping the created objects in reverse order of dependency:
    1.  Drop indexes: `idx_todos_folder_id`, `idx_todos_user_id`, `idx_folders_user_id`.
    2.  Drop tables: `todos`, then `folders`.
* No dedicated rollback script is provided, following the forward-fix approach.
