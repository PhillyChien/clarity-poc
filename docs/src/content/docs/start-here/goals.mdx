### Problem:

This project serves as a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to establish and validate a modern, robust technical architecture for a web application focused on task and information management. 

It aims to demonstrate a clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers, along with secure authentication and efficient development practices.

### Vision:

The "Clarity POC" envisions a foundational application demonstrating key functionalities like user management, task (Todo) handling, and organizational structures (Folders). 

The primary goal is to provide developers with a clear, well-documented, and easily runnable example of a full-stack application using the chosen technology stack. This POC can serve as a blueprint or starting point for building more complex productivity or management tools.
