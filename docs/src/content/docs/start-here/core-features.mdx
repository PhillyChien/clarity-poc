The Clarity POC implements the following essential features:

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration (`/register`) and login (`/login`) mechanisms utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) signed with RSA keys. Includes a public endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) for JWK Set retrieval.
- **User Management:** Allows retrieval of user information (`/users/me`) and, for authorized roles (Admin/Moderator), listing all users and updating user roles.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements distinct user roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_MODERATOR`, `ROLE_ADMIN`) with corresponding permissions enforced in the backend.
- **Todo Management:** Provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing individual tasks (Todos).
- **Folder Management:** Offers full CRUD operations for creating and organizing content within folders.
- **API Documentation:** Integrates OpenAPI (Swagger) for automatic generation and visualization of the backend REST API documentation.
