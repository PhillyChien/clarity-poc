This document explains how to generate RSA key pairs for JWT authentication and configure them in the system.

## Why RSA Keys?

We use RSA key pairs to sign and verify JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This approach has the following advantages:

1. **Security**: Using asymmetric encryption algorithms (RSA) is more secure than symmetric encryption (like HMAC)
2. **Separability**: Public keys can be safely shared with clients to verify tokens, while private keys remain only on the server
3. **Consistency**: Using fixed keys ensures that tokens remain valid across service restarts

### Configuring RSA Keys

There are two ways to configure RSA keys:

#### Method 1: Using PEM Format Key Files (Recommended)

This is the simplest and most secure method, using standard PEM format key files:

1. Place the generated `private_key.pem` and `public_key.pem` files in a secure location
2. Configure the following environment variables to point to these files:
   ```bash
   export JWT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="/path/to/private_key.pem"
   export JWT_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE="/path/to/public_key.pem"
   export JWT_KID="your-key-id"
   ```

3. Or in `application.yml`:
   ```yaml
   jwt:
     rsa:
       private-key-file: "/path/to/private_key.pem"
       public-key-file: "/path/to/public_key.pem"
     kid: "your-key-id"
   ```

#### Method 2: Using Environment Variables (Base64 Encoded)

Convert the PEM files to Base64 format and provide them through environment variables:

```bash
# Convert private key to Base64 (remove headers and newlines)
export JWT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat private_key.pem | grep -v "BEGIN\|END" | tr -d '\n')

# Convert public key to Base64 (remove headers and newlines)
export JWT_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat public_key.pem | grep -v "BEGIN\|END" | tr -d '\n')

export JWT_KID="your-key-id"
```

## Key Priority

The system looks for key configurations in the following order:

1. PEM file paths (`private-key-file` and `public-key-file`)
2. Azure Key Vault (only for production environment)
3. Base64 encoded strings (`private-key` and `public-key`)

## Important Notes

1. **Secure the private key**: The private key must be kept confidential and only used on the server
2. **File permissions**: Ensure key files are only readable by necessary users
3. **Rotate keys regularly**: It's recommended to rotate key pairs periodically for enhanced security
4. **Backup your keys**: Make sure to back up your keys to prevent loss
5. **Production environments**: In production, it's recommended to use the PEM file method or environment variables

## Development Environment Setup

For the development environment, RSA keys have already been set up:

1. **Key location**: The keys are stored in `backend/src/main/resources/keys/`:
   - Private key: `private_key.pem`
   - Public key: `public_key.pem`

2. **Key ID**: A fixed Key ID (`646b2b4576e3e06abfcee95c8e7d19f2`) is configured in `application-dev.yml`

3. **Configuration**: The development environment configuration in `application-dev.yml` already points to these keys using classpath references:
   ```yaml
   jwt:
     rsa:
       private-key-file: classpath:keys/private_key.pem
       public-key-file: classpath:keys/public_key.pem
     kid: 646b2b4576e3e06abfcee95c8e7d19f2
   ```

This setup allows you to start development without additional configuration. However, these keys should **never** be used in production environments. 

## Production Environment Setup

For the production environment, RSA keys are configured in Azure Key Vault. 

1. **Key Vault Configuration**: We don't need to configure the Key Vault in `application.yml`, it will be automatically configured by the Spring Cloud Azure Key Vault Starter.
However, we need to configure the keyvault endpoint in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    azure:
      keyvault:
        secret:
          property-sources:
            - name: default
              endpoint: ${AZURE_KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT}
```
