## Prerequisites

* **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 17 or later is required for the backend.
* **Maven:** For building the backend and managing Java dependencies.

## Setup Backend Development Environment

Use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file to start the development environment. It will start the database and execute the Flyway migrations.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

To stop and clean up the development environment, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
```

### JWT RSA Key Pair

Normally the JWT RSA key pair has been generated and stored in the `backend/src/main/resources/keys` and `backend/src/test/resources/keys` directories. 

If you want to generate a new key pair, please refer to the below,

## Run the Backend Application in Development Mode

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Use the `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev` command to start the backend application in development mode. Note: The `application-dev.yml` file is already configured with the JWT RSA key pair.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

3. The backend will start on port 8080. You can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

## Test the Backend Application

Use the `./mvnw test` command to run the tests. Note: The `application-test.yml` file is already configured with the JWT RSA key pair.

```bash
./mvnw test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```
