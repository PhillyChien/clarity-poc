## Introduction

**Frontend** contains the React application for the this project. 
It provides the user interface for interacting with the backend API, managing Todos and Folders, handling user authentication, and includes specific views for different user roles (Normal, Moderator, Super Admin). 
Azure Clarity is integrated into this frontend to monitor user behavior.


## Key technologies used

* **Framework/Library:** React
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui
* **HTTP Client:** Fetch API (Native Browser API)
* **Linting/Formatting:** Biome


## Development Notes

* The development server usually supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for faster feedback during development.
* Ensure the backend API URL configured in your `.env` file matches where your backend is actually running.
* Refer to the Biome configuration (`biome.json`) for code linting and formatting standards. Run `pnpm check` and `pnpm check:fix` to check your code.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The frontend application is configured to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`.
