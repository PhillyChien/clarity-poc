Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend application locally for development purposes.


## Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** An active LTS version is recommended (e.g., v18 or v20). Node.js includes `npm`, which is needed to install `pnpm`.
* **PNPM:** The package manager used for frontend and docs dependencies. Install it globally via npm after installing Node.js: `npm install -g pnpm`.
* **Backend:** The backend API service and PostgreSQL database **must be running**. For local development, this is typically achieved using the `start-dev.sh` script or the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file located in the **root** of the project repository, as described in the main project README. Ensure the backend is accessible (usually at `http://localhost:8080`).

## Setup Frontend Development Environment

Use the `start-dev.sh` script to start the development environment. 

This will start the database and execute the Flyway migrations, then start the backend.

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

## Run the Frontend Application in Development Mode

Once you have the prerequisites ready, follow these steps to set up and run the frontend application locally for development purposes.

1.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    Open your terminal and change to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the project dependencies using your chosen package manager:
    ```bash
    # Using pnpm
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Look for an `.env.example` file in the `frontend` directory.
    * Copy it to create your own environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    * Edit the `.env.local` file and ensure the variables are set correctly, especially the one pointing to your running backend API:
        ```dotenv
        # Example for Vite-based projects
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
        ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

5.  **Access the Application:**
    * The terminal output will indicate the local address where the frontend is being served. This is often:
        * `http://localhost:5173` (common for Vite)
    * Open this URL in your web browser. You should see the login or registration page.
