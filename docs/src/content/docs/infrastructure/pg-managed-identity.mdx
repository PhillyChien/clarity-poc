This guide explains how to manage Microsoft Entra roles in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI
- psql
- Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server is deployed
- Azure AD authentication is enabled (via)

### 1. Create Azure AD Administrator for PostgreSQL

The Azure AD Administrator is required to register Azure AD identities as PostgreSQL roles.

```bash
az postgres flexible-server ad-admin create \
  --resource-group <your-rg> \
  --server-name <your-server> \
  --display-name "<your-username>" \
  --object-id <your-aad-object-id>
```

:::tip
- `<your-rg>` is `clarity-poc-staging-rg`
- `<your-server>` is `clarity-poc-staging-psql-flex`
- `<your-username>` is `chienaeae@gmail.com`
- `<your-aad-object-id>` is `4b3716f9-e037-4236-b013-74b3a5d9758`
:::

<details>
<summary>If you are not sure the object ID of the current signed-in user</summary>
**Display the current signed-in user's object ID**
```bash
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
```
**Display the current signed-in user's username**
```bash
az account show --query user.name -o tsv
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>To verify the Azure AD Administrator has been created</summary>

```bash
az postgres flexible-server ad-admin list \
  --resource-group <your-rg> \
  --server-name <your-server>
```

It will print the created Azure AD Administrator information, including the object ID.

</details>

### 2. Login to PostgreSQL as AD Administrator using Azure AD Access Token

Now, we need to prepare the token to login to PostgreSQL as AD Administrator.

Acquire an access token for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server resource.
```bash
export PGPASSWORD=$(az account get-access-token \
  --resource-type oss-rdbms \
  --query accessToken -o tsv)
```

Connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server using the access token.
```bash
psql "host=<your-server>.postgres.database.azure.com \
      port=5432 \
      dbname=postgres \
      user=<your-username> \
      sslmode=require"

```

:::tip
- `dbname` uses built-in database `postgres`, not `<your-database>`
- `<your-username>` is the username of the Azure AD Administrator created in step 1
:::

### 3. Assign a role to the Managed Identity

Use the following command to create the Microsoft Entra non-admin user for your Managed Identity

```sql
select * from pgaadauth_create_principal('<roleName>', false, false);

--- Example:
--- select * from pg_catalog.pgaadauth_create_principal('clarity-poc-staging-backend', false, false);
```


### 4. (Optional) Verify the AAD Role in PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pgaadauth_list_principals(<isAdmin>);

--- Example 1:
--- SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pgaadauth_list_principals(true);
--- This is used to list the admin AAD users.

--- Example 2:
--- SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pgaadauth_list_principals(false);
--- This is used to list both admin and non-admin AAD users.
```

### 5. (Optional) Drop the existing AAD Role in PostgreSQL

```sql
DROP ROLE "<roleName>";
```
:::tip
Be sure to replace `<roleName>` (enclosed in double quotes) with the actual role name.
:::


### 6. (Optional) Grant `role_table_grants` permissions to the created role

Use the following command to grant the necessary permissions to the role (Note: You should use the same user doing the migration to grant the permissions)

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO "<roleName>";
--- Example:
--- ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
--- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO "clarity-poc-staging-backend";
--- This is used to automatically grant the permissions to future tables in the public schema.

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "<roleName>";
--- Example:
--- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "clarity-poc-staging-backend";
--- This is used to grant the permissions to all tables in the public schema.

```

:::tip
Use the following command to check the permissions are granted successfully:
  - Table role_table_grants
    ```sql
    SELECT
        grantee,
        table_schema,
        table_name,
        privilege_type
    FROM
        information_schema.role_table_grants
    WHERE
        grantee = '<roleName>';
    ```
:::


### 7. (Optional) Grant `role_usage_grants` permissions to the created role

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO "<roleName>";
--- Example:
--- ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
--- GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO "clarity-poc-staging-backend";
--- This is used to automatically grant the permissions to future sequences in the public schema.

GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO "<roleName>";
--- Example:
--- GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO "clarity-poc-staging-backend";
--- This is used to grant the permissions to all sequences in the public schema.
```

:::tip
Use the following command to check the permissions are granted successfully:
  - Sequence role_usage_grants
    ```sql
    SELECT
        object_schema AS sequence_schema,
        object_name AS sequence_name,
        privilege_type
    FROM
        information_schema.role_usage_grants
    WHERE
        grantee = '<roleName>'
        AND object_type = 'SEQUENCE';
    ```
