This project uses Terraform to manage Azure cloud services, including the following components:

### Core Resources
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: For storing and managing container images
- **Azure App Services (2)**: For deploying and running applications
  - App Service 1: Frontend application
  - App Service 2: Backend API service (migrated to Container App)
- **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server**: For data storage and management (Migrated from Single Server version due to Azure retirement plan)

### Supporting Resources
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: For network isolation and security management
- **Azure Key Vault**: For secure storage of secrets and certificates
- **Application Insights**: For monitoring application performance and usage
- **Azure Storage Account**: For storing static assets and backups

## Two-Part Deployment

The infrastructure is separated into two deployment parts:

1. **Core Infrastructure** (modules/core)
   - Resource Group
   - Networking
   - Azure Container Registry
   - PostgreSQL Database
   - Log Analytics Workspace
   - Key Vault
   - Application Insights
   - Storage Account

2. **Application Infrastructure** (modules/app)
   - Frontend App Service
   - Backend Container App

## Environment Configuration

This project uses an environment-based folder structure. Currently, only a staging environment is implemented, but the structure supports additional environments (e.g., development, production) in the future. 

Resource naming convention follows the `{project_name}-{environment}-{resource_type}` format.

## Module Structure Benefits

Using modular infrastructure design provides several benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between core and application infrastructure
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update specific parts of the infrastructure
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different environments
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Complex infrastructure is divided into manageable components
5. **Better Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously

## Notes

- All secrets should be stored in Azure Key Vault
- Network Security Groups should be properly configured to restrict access
- Terraform remote state storage is configured but commented out; uncomment and configure the backend section in provider.tf when ready to use
