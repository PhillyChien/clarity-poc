This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the infrastructure in two separate parts.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Terraform (v1.11.3 or later)
2. Configure Azure credentials (Azure CLI or Service Principal)
3. Navigate to the infrastructure directory: `cd infra`

## Part 1: Deploy Core Infrastructure

This part deploys all foundational infrastructure components:

```bash
# Navigate to the staging environment directory
cd environments/staging

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment of core infrastructure
terraform plan -target=module.core -out=core.tfplan

# Review the plan then apply it
terraform apply core.tfplan
```

## After Core Infrastructure is deployed

- Setup GitHub Actions Secrets for ACR Deployment

- Build and push Docker images to ACR through GitHub Actions (You can use workflow_dispatch to trigger the deployment)

- Setup JWT RSA Key in Key Vault (You can use scripts/store_jwt_key.sh to store the key pair in Key Vault)

## Part 2: Deploy Application Infrastructure

```bash
# Plan the deployment of application infrastructure
terraform plan -target=module.app -out=app.tfplan

# Review the plan then apply it
terraform apply app.tfplan
```

## After Application Infrastructure is deployed

- Setup Manged Identity for backend container app

## Verification Steps

1. After Core infrastructure deployment:
   - Verify that the resource group is created
   - Confirm database is accessible
   - Check that container registry is ready

2. After Application infrastructure deployment:
   - Check that the frontend app is running
   - Verify the backend container app is operational
   - Test the connectivity between the frontend and backend

## Using the Deployment Script

A deployment script is provided to simplify the process:

```bash
# Deploy core infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh core

# Deploy application infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh app
```

## Module Structure

The infrastructure is organized into two main modules:

1. **Core module** (`modules/core`):
   - Contains all fundamental infrastructure resources
   - Includes resource group, networking, database, etc.

2. **Application module** (`modules/app`):
   - Contains application-specific resources
   - Includes frontend and backend applications

This modular structure allows for clearer organization and easier maintenance.

## Troubleshooting

- If any service fails to deploy, check Azure portal for error details
- For database connectivity issues, verify the firewall settings
- For container app issues, check the container registry access permissions
