## Overview

The application utilizes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user capabilities. Access to specific API endpoints is granted based on the user's assigned role.

*Note: This application currently uses roles directly for authorization checks (e.g., `hasRole('MODERATOR')`) rather than separate, fine-grained permission strings (e.g., `hasAuthority('UPDATE_USER')`).*

## Defined Roles

The POC defines the following roles in the `Role` enum (`backend/src/main/java/com/aifinancial/clarity/poc/model/Role.java`):

- **`NORMAL`:**
    - **Description:** Standard user account.
    - **API Access:** Can access endpoints for managing their own profile, and perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own Todos and Folders.

- **`MODERATOR`:**
    - **Description:** Users with elevated privileges for user oversight.
    - **API Access:** Includes all `NORMAL` role access. Additionally, can access the endpoint to list all users (`/api/v1/users`).

- **`SUPER_ADMIN`:**
    - **Description:** Highest level of access, intended for system administrators.
    - **API Access:** Includes all `MODERATOR` role access. Additionally, can access the endpoint to update any user's role (`/api/v1/users/{id}/role`). Has implicit access to all system functionalities defined by the available endpoints.

## Permissions Summary

| Feature / API Area             | `NORMAL` | `MODERATOR` | `SUPER_ADMIN` |
| ------------------------------ | :------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
| CRUD Own Todos                 |    ✅    |      ✅     |       ✅      |
| CRUD Own Folders               |    ✅    |      ✅     |       ✅      |
| List All Users                 |    ❌    |      ✅     |       ✅      |
| Update User Role               |    ❌    |      ❌     |       ✅      |
| Ban/Unban *Any* Todo           |    ❌    |      ✅     |       ✅      |

## Business Value

- **Security:** Ensures data privacy and integrity by restricting access based on user responsibilities.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Allows administrators (`SUPER_ADMIN`) to delegate user viewing tasks to `MODERATOR` roles without granting full user management capabilities.
- **Scalability:** Provides a structured way to manage access as the application grows in complexity and user base.
