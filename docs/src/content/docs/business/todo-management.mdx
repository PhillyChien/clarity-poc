## Overview

The Todo Management feature is a core component of the application, allowing users to create, track, and manage their tasks effectively. To keep tasks organized, users can optionally group them using Folders.

## Core Todo Functionality

- **Create Todos:** Users can create new tasks, assigning a title and description.
- **Read Todos:** Users can view their list of existing Todos.
- **Update Todos:** Existing Todos can be modified (e.g., changing details, marking as complete).
- **Delete Todos:** Users can remove Todos that are no longer needed.
- **Ban/Unban Todos (Moderator/Admin):** Users with `MODERATOR` or `SUPER_ADMIN` roles can ban specific Todos to prevent further interaction by the user. This is an administrative action.

## Organizing Todos with Folders

Folders provide a way to structure and categorize Todos:

- **Create Folders:** Users can create new folders to group related Todos.
- **Assign Todos to Folders:** When creating or updating a Todo, it can be assigned to a specific folder.
- **View Todos by Folder:** Users can filter or view their Todos based on the folder they belong to.
- **Manage Folders:** Users can also rename or delete folders as needed.

## Business Value

- **Improved Productivity & Organization:** Provides a central place for users to manage tasks, with folders helping to structure work, reduce clutter, and make information easier to find.
- **Task Visibility:** Allows users to easily see the status and organization of ongoing work, potentially filtered by folder.
- **Foundation for Collaboration:** This structure lays the groundwork for future collaborative features involving shared tasks and folders.
